### Turning Benchmarks into Your Success

1. **Leverage managed AI services**
   – AWS, Azure, or GCP accelerators drastically cut setup time and operational overhead.

2. **Focus on generative use cases**
   – Customer support bots, content generation, and R&D assistants consistently deliver above-average returns.

3. **Invest in skills & governance**
   – Rapid upskilling plus early data and ethical guardrails safeguard performance and compliance.

4. **Measure and iterate**
   – Track deployment timelines, ROI milestones, and user-experience KPIs, then refine models and configs to optimize.
